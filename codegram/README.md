React Typescript - Web Chat Application 
===========================================

I wanted to make a chat application with a bit more functionality than having an simple chat. The project is built with React.js, Typescript, tailwind etc
It can be viewed [here](https://react-typescript-chat-ap-d6740.web.app/).

## Functionality
The app allows you to create post, delete post if you are the cone who created the post, bookmark post, like post,
comment on post, search users profile, update profile, and more

you can signin and login

## Getting Started
The app can be installed by cloning the Git repository and running 'npm install' in the project directory. Once all packages are installed, you can run 'npm start' to run the app in localhost.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have node and npm installed.
